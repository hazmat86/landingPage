# landingPage
This is the repository for my landing page, the penultimate project in the Odin Project's foundations course. Please bear in mind that this page is currently a work in progress and will be undergoing live changes as I progress through the content. While the purpose of this page is to showcase my skillset in HTML and CSS (at this point in time) I will be using it for much more such as showcasing my skillset in Javascript, promoting my personal brand, documenting my journey towars employment in the tech industry, and quite a bit more. Please check back in from time to time to get updates and check out new things that I'm learning. Also, feel free to contact me with questions, comments, ideas or just saying hello!
